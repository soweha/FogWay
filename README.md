## *Soweha - Fogway*


### Introduction:

Soweha, a startup that focuses in developing unique remedies for common issues, developed a product named Fogway. To assist drivers in navigating through dense fog, Fogway was developed. Advanced sensors are utilised by the product to recognise impediments in the driver's path and alert them about possible dangers.

### About Fogway

Fogway is a type of product that can be useful on the road during heavy fog. When an obstacle is detected, it alerts the driver with an alarm sound, helping them avoid a collision. The product is easy to use and can be installed in any vehicle. It is a safety device that can prevent accidents caused by poor visibility in foggy weather.

### How it works

Fogway uses a combination of sensors and algorithms to detect obstacles on the road during heavy fog. The device is installed on the dashboard of the vehicle and has a visual display to show the distance of the detected obstacle. The product also makes an alarm sound to alert the driver about the obstacle.

### How to Use Fogway

To use Fogway, simply attach it to the front of your vehicle. The device will automatically turn on when it detects fog and start scanning for obstacles. If it detects an obstacle, it will sound an alarm to alert the driver.

### Before and After Using Fogway

Before using Fogway, drivers may have difficulty seeing the road ahead due to poor visibility caused by fog. This can be dangerous and lead to accidents. After using Fogway, drivers will be able to navigate safely even in heavy fog, as the device will detect obstacles and give an alert to the driver.

### Idea Introduction

The idea for the Fogway project was introduced by our team member [`AKASH C J`](https://github.com/ACJ007). Driving in heavy fog can be extremely dangerous, and there are limited solutions available to alert the driver of any obstacles on the road. The Fogway project is designed to sense any obstacles on the road and provide an alert to the driver, making it easier and safer to navigate through heavy fog.

### Conclusion

We are committed to creating products that have a positive impact on people's lives. With Fogway, we believe we have achieved that goal, and we look forward to continuing to develop innovative solutions for the challenges of our time.
